Kelly Sweet-¡¶Dream On¡· 

Everytime that I look in the mirror.
All these lines on my face gettin' clearer. 
The past is gone. 
It went by like dusk 2 dawn. 
Isn't that the way ?  
Everybody's got their dues in life 2 pay. 
I know what nobody knows. 
Where it comes & where it goes. 
I know it's everybody's sin. 
U got 2 lose 2 know how 2 win. 
Half my life is in books' written pages. 
Live & learn from fools & from sages. 
U know it's true. 
All the things U do,come back 2 U. 
Sing with me,sing 4 the year. 
Sing 4 the laugh & sing 4 the tear. 
Sing with me,if it's just 4 today. 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take U away. 
Sing with me,sing 4 the year. 
Sing 4 the laugh & sing 4 the tear. 
Sing with me,if it's just 4 today. 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take U away. 
Dream On,Dream On,Dream On !  
Dream until Urself dream come true. 
Dream On,Dream On,Dream On !  
Dream until Ur dream comes true.
Dream On,Dream On,Dream On !  
Dream On,Dream On,Dream On !  
Sing with me,sing 4 the year. 
Sing 4 the laugh & sing 4 the tear.
Sing with me,if it's just 4 today. 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take U away. 
Sing with me,sing 4 the year. 
Sing 4 the laugh & sing 4 the tear. 
Sing with me,if it's just 4 today. 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take U away.

Hot N Cold
Katy Perry
 
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak
Crypticly
 
I should know
That you're no good for me
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(you) You don't really want to stay, no
(but you) But you don't really want to go o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now your plain boring
I should know that
You're not gonna change
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(you) You don't really want to stay, no
(but you) But you don't really want to go o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
 
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(you) You don't really want to stay, no
(but you) But you don't really want to go o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

nothing's  ganna  change  my  love  for  you

all  rise

it's  ok

the  colour  of  the  night

doctor  Jones

because  of  you

magic  key

beat  it

cry  on  my  shoulder

soledad

swear  it  again

flying  without  wings

change  the  world

what  makes  a  man

dont  push  me

when   you  say   nothing  at  all

better  man

i'll  be  there  for  you

way  back  into  love 

show  me  the  meaning

a  man  for  all  seasons

dont  cry  for  me  Argentina

let  me  be  the  one 

nobody's  fool

when  you're  gone

my  happy  ending

tomorrow

girlfriend

innocence

knockin  on  heaven's  door

i  can  do   better

if  you  seek  Amy

Passion is sweet
Love makes weak
You said you cherised freedom so
You refused to let it go

Follow your faith 
Love and hate
never failed to seize the day
Don't give yourself away

Oh when the night falls
And your all alone
In your deepest sleep 
What are you dreeeming of

My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough 
I said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
So the tought keeps spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If you're the rock I'll crush against

Trapped in a crowd
Music's loud
I said I loved my freedom too
Now im not so sure i do

All eyes on you
Wings so true
Better quit while your ahead
Now im not so sure i am

Oh when the night falls
And your all alone
In your deepest sleep
What are you dreaming of

My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
I said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
So the thought keeps spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade 
I can't predict where it ends
If you're the rock I'll crush against

My soul, my heart
If your near or if your far
My life, my love
You can have it all

Oh when the night falls
And your all alone
In your deepest sleep
What are you dreaming of

My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh I just can't get enough
I said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous 
So the thought keeps spinning in my head
Can we drop this masquerade
I can't predict where it ends
If you're the rock I'll crush against

If you're the rock i'll crush agains
